This package is the portable version of LibreSSL (http://www.libressl.org). 

LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL developed by the OpenBSD project
(http://www.openbsd.org). LibreSSL is developed on OpenBSD. This
package then adds portability shims for other operating systems. 

Official release tarballs are available at your friendly neighborhood
OpenBSD mirror in directory LibreSSL, e.g.:
http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/LibreSSL/
although it is suggested you use a mirror. 

A github clone of the official repositories is kept at:
https://github.com/libressl-portable
We update this repository semi-frequently, but it should be used for
informational purposes only.

./configure && make check && make install

See crypto/compat for the bulk of the local compatibility code. 

It will likely build on any reasonably modern version of Linux, Solaris,
or OSX with a sane compiler and C library.
